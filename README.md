# README
## gitflow4code
This is a Visual Studio Code extension that adds support for branching strategy used by git-flow

### What's included
Very basic support has been added allowing the user to:
* Initialize a repository with default values (develop, master, release, hotfix)
* Start/Finish Feature branches
* Start/Finish Release branches
* Start/Finish Hotfix branches
* Get the status of a git repository

### gitflow4code roadmap
* Allow feature branches to be based off of branches other than develop

## Dependencies
* git (if you have installed VS Code, this should also already exist on your machine)

### For more information on git-flow
