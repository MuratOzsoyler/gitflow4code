# README
## gitflow4code
This is a Visual Studio Code extension that adds support for git-flow

### What's included
In this early release, very basic support has been added allowing the user to:
* Start/Finish Feature branches
* Start/Finish Release branches (without tags)
* Start/Finish Hotfix branches (without tags)
* Get the status of a git repository

### gitflow4code roadmap
In future releases, more robust support for allowing tags and other command line options
will be added.

## Dependencies
* git (if you have installed VS Code, this should also already exist on your machine)
* [git-flow](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh)
